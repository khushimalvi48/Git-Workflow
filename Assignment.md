# This to to simulate Git use while working in an organization.

Task 1: Created and initialized a gitHub Repo from scratch
+ Setup working Directory on local machine
+ Initialized git on it --> git init
  
Task 2: Forking Repository and cloning to local repository on which organization is working. Here, for practice I have used a public repo available.
+ Forked a public repository
+ Clone to local Directory
