# This to to simulate Git use while working in an organization.

Task 1: Created and initialized a gitHub Repo from scratch
+ Setup working Directory on local machine
+ Initialized git on it --> git init
  
Task 2: Forking Repository and cloning to local repository on which organization is working. Here, for practice I have used a public repo available.
+ Forked a public repository
+ Clone to local Directory

Task 3: Created a feature branch made changes in the java code practiced concepts like - reset, revert, restore, stashing, merging, cherry-pick. 

Task 4: Then connected to remote branch via SSH and pushed the feature branch to create a PR.

Task 5: once the PR was reviewed (I did for myself). there was time to merge the feature branch to main, found some conflicts
To resolve them I opened the files removed the markers and kept the required code and finally merged it.

Task 6: Practiced Tag (used mainly while release), and then to keep the commit history clean and linear practiced rebase.
